BS3 Graphic device
Maximum 160x100 8bits (1 byte color index from 0 to 255) per pixel view port (view port is what is seen on screen after REFRESH command)
Videoram : 2 x 64KiB : 2 x (256 width x 256 Height pixels)
Tile, Tile Map, Sprites (with collision pixel perfect) features available

Internally there are 2 surfaces of 256x256 pixels (2 x 64 KiB video ram)
Surface coordinates are expressed by a word (16 bits) : MSB Y coordinate (0 to 255) LSB X coordinate (0 to 255)
Only one viewport of maximum 160x100 pixels is visible on screen
Only the REFRESH command can display the current content of the viewport to the screen (except if automatic REFRESH is set on PB7 )
At any time a view port is defined by:
    surface number (wich video ram)
         0 or 1 (0 is default after RESET command)
    coordinates of top left corner of the view port in the selected surface
        16 bits : MSB Y coordinate (from 0 to 255) LSB X coordinate (from 0 to 255) (0,0 by default at RESET time)
    viewport width
        from 1 to 160 (160 is default after RESET command)
    viewport height
        from 1 to 100 (100 is default after RESET command)

Color palette:
    Each pixel color is represented by 1 byte (8 bits) with value from 0 to 255.
    Each color index is represented by an standard color
    The BS3 GFX device use two standards : IBM 16 colors and ANSI 256 colors (256 - 16 ANSI colors).
    Color index from 0 to 15 are mapped to the IBM PC default color palette
        index   Name (IBM)      Red (0..5)	Green(0..5) Blue(0..5)  (equivalent to ANSI 256 colors Index)

    Color index from 16 to 255 are mapped to ANSI terminal 256 colors palette.
    ANSI 256 colors palette integrate 216 RGB colors
      6 values of Red Green Blue (from 0 to 5)
      To compute the color index with a RGB (6 values per channel) apply this computation
      color index = 16 + (Red * 36 + Green * 6 + Blue)
      A possible conversion RGB 888 (24 bits) to ANSI RGB 216 colors can be done by mapping each channel value as follow
        from 0 to 26    : 0
        from 27 to 77   : 1
        from 78 to 128  : 2
        from 129 to 179 : 3
        from 180 to 230 : 4
        from 231 to 255 : 5
    ANSI 256 colors palette integrate 24 shades of Gray (Gray value from 0 to 23 : black to white)
      to compute the color index with Gray (24 values) apply this computation
      color index = 232 +  Gray (color index from 232 to 255)

I/O : 0120 to 0127 (height registers 8/16 bits registers )
    0120        : write         : 8 bits command
    0120        : read          : 8 bits status  : BUSY:7, WAITFORDATA:6, ENABLE:5, COMMAND_STATUS_CODE:4-0
    0121..0127  : read/write    : 8/16 bits registers : Input parameters / Output results (referenced as PB1 to PB7 for Byte value, and PW1 to PW7 for word value)
        0121 : PB1 or PW1
        0122 : PB2 or PW2
        0123 : PB3 or PW3
        0124 : PB4 or PW4
        0125 : PB5 or PW5
        0126 : PB6 or PW6
        0127 : PB7 or PW7 (PB7 reserved for auto REFRESH command)
   example : a byte write to 0121 is a write to PB1 register
             a word wrtite to 0121 is a write to PW1 register
            PW1 does not contains PB1 , it is two separated registers in the device 
            ; code to illustrate the separation of registers
            mov b0, $F4
            mov w1, $AB54
            sr  b0, [$0121] ; PB1 = $F4
            sr  w1, [$0121] ; PW1 = $AB54
            ld  b0, [$0121] ; b0 == $F4
            ld  w1, [$0121] ; w1 == $AB54 , no overlap of PB1 and PW1

If BUSY == 1 then device is busy, therefore the device can't accept any command (write on 0120) or write on PBx or PWx (x from 1 to 7)
If BUSY == 0 and WAITFORDATA == 1 then device is waiting for data reading or data writing from the bus host (e.g CPU)
if BUSY == 0 and WAITFORDATA == 1 then only RESET or END commands are accepted.
If BUSY == 0 and WAITFORDATA == 0 then device is ready to receive new command , and COMMAND_STATUS_CODE is valid indicating the status of last command
a COMMAND_STATUS_CODE equal to 0 means success, other value express an error on previous executed command
a COMMAND_STATUS_CODE == 31 means that previous command execution failed because the command code is unknown.
ENABLE bit status == 0 if no RESET command has been executing successfully or a END command has been executed successfully
ENABLE bit status == 1 gfx device is initialized (RESET command has been executed successfully)
Command starts its execution at write operation to regsiter 0120
All needed parameters has to be written to their respective register before the write to Command register (0120)

Before to request any graphical command, a RESET command must occurs before hand (executed only once before all the other commands ) and
terminated with a success status
the RESET command is like a "Enter graphical mode"
To end properly the use of the device, a command END must be performed and terminated.
The END command is like a "Leave graphical mode"

when writing 1 to PB7, it means that all COMMAND will be terminated by executing a REFRESH commmand (when command modify surface content sucessfully)
when writing 0 to PB7, it means that no automatic REFRESH command is performed after COMMAND execution.

===================================
TILES, TILE MAPS, LAYERS and SPRITES 

TILES
The GFX device has a tile mode. Tile mode ease the access and use of image collection stored on a surface.
Therefore a tile is referenced by 3 informations : 
    a surface     : 2 surfaces referenced by 0 or 1
    a bank number : 4 banks referenced from 0 to 3 
    a index       : 256 tiles if bank tile size is 8x8, referenced from 0 to 255
                    or 64 tiles if bank tile size is 16x16, referenced from 0 to 63
                    or 16 tiles if bank tile size is 32x32, referenced from 0 to 15
                    or 4 tiles if bank tile size is 64x64, referenced from 0 to 3.
There are 8 image banks in totals : 4 image banks per surface

Each bank occupy an area of 256 x 64 pixels on a surface (full surface width , 1/4 surface height)
Each bank is configured with a tile size

|                size 256 x 64                  |
|            from (0,192) to (255,255)          |
+-----------------------------------------------+

Each bank defines a a tile sets (square image) of identical size amongst 8x8, 16x16, 32x32 or 64x64.
Inside a bank, each tile is referenced by an index.

Bank tile of size 8x8, have 32x8 (horizontal nb tiles x vertical nb tiles in bank) = 256 tiles referenced from 0 to 255
  tile index representation in bank, each tile is 8x8 pixels

At reset time all bank tile size on all surfaces are 8x8.

Blitting a tile on to a target surface, can use free coordinates or tile mode coordinates
In tile mode blit target coordinates, there is a grid with a step of 8x8 pixels :
    example:
        if coordinates is $0A03
            absolute it does represent Y=$0A = 10, x=$03 = 3
            tile coordinate it represents Y=$0A x 8 = 80, y=$03 x 8 = 24 (tile coordinates to absolute coordinates conversion)

Any command designating a surface with its bit 7=1 then it will use tile mode
    example:
        if surface is 0, in tile mode its designation is $80 (do set surface number to $80 instead of 0)
        if surface is 1, in tile mode its designation is $81 (do set surface number to $81 instead of 1)

TILE MAP 
    A tile map is a grid of tiles
    There are 2 tile maps of 32x32 cells  (256x256 pixels surface coverage, with a grid step of 8x8 )
        tile map #0 on layer 1
        tile map #1 on layer 2 (closest to the viewport )
        layer 0 is represented by the surface referenced by the view port
    A tile map may be enable/disable (visible/hidden)
    A tile map cell is defined by the following properties
        visibility : 0/1 
        image: (keycolor or OR/AND mask or copy ()) (similar as sprite)
                in key color rendering
                    : surface number 
                    : bank number
                    : index number
                    : key color 
                in mask rendering
                    OR image
                        : surface number
                        : bank number
                        : index number
                    AND image (mask) use same surface as OR image
                        : bank number (if bank == $FF then the mask is considered as only 0 (copy tile ), then index number is ignored)
                        :             (if bank == $F0 then the mask is considered as only $FF (or tile), then index number is ignored)
                        : index number (on same surface as OR image)
        Metadata : 16 bits meta data (arbitrary data to be used by a program)

SPRITES
    Sprites are individual picture rendered on surface but is not in its memory
    a sprites is configured with a set of properties
        image: (keycolor or OR/AND mask or copy ()) do reference to tile
                in key color rendering
                    : surface number 
                    : bank number
                    : index number
                    : key color 
                in mask rendering
                    OR image
                        : surface number
                        : bank number
                        : index number
                    AND image (mask)
                        : bank number (if bank == $FF then the mask is considered as only 0 (copy tile ), then index number is ignored)
                        :             (if bank == $F0 then the mask is considered as only $FF (or tile), then index number is ignored)
                        : index number (on same surface as OR image)
        visibility: visible/hidden
        collision: can collide other collide-able sprites
        target surface: always the same surface as the viewport
        coordinates : absolute coordinates 
        Z coordinate : 0 = between layer 0 and 1
                       1 = between layer 1 and 2
                       2 = above layer 2
                       3 = exist but is not rendered
        metadata : 16 bits metadata

GFX device may handle 128 sprites (identified by a byte number from 0 to 127)
If sprite A & B overlapp and are on the same Z coordinate, then if sprite index of A is < to sprite index B then B is rendered over A 
if sprite A has a Z value higher than sprite B Z value then A is rendered over B.

SPRITE collision detection
GFX device handle pixel perfect sprite collisions : there is collision when a visible pixel of two sprites overlapped
  GFX device handle collision of from-to sprites: collision from sprite A to sprite B (the 2 sprites must be collision enabled)
  this imply that if A collide B , then B collide A : 2 collsions when 2 sprites collide.
  the number of collision is limited to 255, meaning there are collisions that are ignored if there is too much collisions (maximum above 16000 collisions : from A to B and from B to A)
  As the number of collision is limited there is a priority to compute the collision:
     Sprite A and sprite B , with A and B representing their respective sprite Id (from 0 to 127 )
     the sprite Id represent its collision priority , then 127 has higher priority than 126 ... sprite id 0 has the lowest priority

LAYERS

   Tile map / surface / sprite layering
View port rendering is the superposed result of the layers and sprites, 
Therefore layer 2 cover layer 1 that cover layer 0

    ______________________
   /                     /  <- above layer 2 : sprites with Z = 2 
  /   Layer 2           /
 /    Tile map #1      /
/                     /___
----------------------   /  <- between layer 1 & 2 : sprites with Z = 1
  /   Layer 1           /
 /    Tile map #0      /
/                     /___
----------------------   /  <- between layer 0 & 1 : sprites with Z = 0
  /   Layer 0           /
 /    Surface          /  Surface is the one chosen by the view port configuration
/                     /
----------------------
Sprite with Z=3 is not rendered but exist as if it is rendered.
All layers are the same size (256 x 256 pixels)
The tile maps and the sprites rendering do not modify the underlying surface video ram (They are overlays)

    Output
        At any moment during the trasnfer the following registers provide current progress of bit transfer
        PW1 : current progress Y (from 0 to HH -1 ) (next write PB3 relative rectangle coordinate )
        PW5 : current progress X (from 0 to XX -1 ) (next write PB3 relative rectangle coordinate )
        PW6 : current address on selected surface   (next write PB3 surface address (coordinates))
Description
    transfer a rectangle(top left corner coordinates and size) of pixels from CPU/host to device chosen surface.
    after Command write the status BUSY bit should be 0 and WAITFORDATA must be 1
    write a byte color index on PB3 X times (X = PW4:HH * PW4:WW (if HH = 0 then HH = 256, if WW = 0 the WW == 256 ))
    Any write to PW3 will interrupt the data transfer
    Before to write to PB3 register, be sure that BUSY == 0, otherwise the write is ignored.
    the pixel stored on the surface is at progressive coordinates starting at PW2 coordinates, then progress from left to right and top to bottom
    ( respecting the size defined by PW4, current next coordinate on surface in PW6 )
    when all pixels are received, the end of transfer is indicated by WAITFORDATA == 0 and BUSY == 0
    During pixel transfer process (WAITFORDATA == 1), no new command is accepted (write COMMAND is ignored except for RESET or END) and
    write to register is forbidden except for PB3 and PW3.
        you may break the transfert by writing anything on PW3 (word write instead of byte write on PB3) or by executing a RESET or END command
    if PB7 != 0 then the automatic REFRESH command is perfomed when transfer is complete (not when trasnfer is broken)
    NB : during the transfer process BS3 GFX device modify information registers (PW6, PW5, PW1)
Status 
    BUSY == 0 and WAITFORDATA == 1 when the device is ready to receive the data
    COMMAND_STATUS_CODE when BUSY == 0 and WAITFORDATA == 0
        0 : transfer is done
        1 : Device not initialiazed (device was not reset)
        3 : incorrect surface number (not 0 nor 1)
        5 : broken data transfer (by host word write to PW3)

Command $17
parameter
    Input
        N/a
    Output
        PB1 : Number of collision (max 256)
Description
    get the number of collision between sprites
    For instance if sprite A collide sprite B (pixel perfect collision , by tile mask or computed mask if tile use keycolor)
    then there are 2 collisions : A collide B and B collide A
    collision detection is enabled if both sprites define their PB6 bit3=1 (collision detect)
    if A collide B and C, but B and C does not collide each other, then there are 4 collisions
        A collide B
        B collide A
        A collide C 
        C collide A

Description
    make visible/invisible layer and sprite at Z coordinate
    at reset time all is visible
    layer visibility is independant to TILE_MAP_CONFIG:
        if tilemap is visible but render on layer is not visible : tile map is not visible
        if tilemap is not visible but  render on layer is visible : tile map is not visible
    sprite visibility is independant to SPRITE_CONFIG
    to see the effect of this command, REFRESH need to be performed afterward.
