R15 : 1111 :PC: Program counter

There is two set of R0 to R15 registers: one when flag K=0 (Supervisor: interrupt handling),     another one when K=1 (user: normal execution)
K=0 and context change when flag is updated by program or by receiving an external interrupt signal (if I flag is set to 1)
when going from K=1 to K=0 all registers are switch to the interrupt handling register set: register R14 (flags) is modified with K=0, I=0 if switch occurs due to 
external context switching, I=1 if the switch occurs due to the program. 
In context when K=0, I flag a no effect (is like I is always = 0), no re-entrant interrupt possible. But "wait" insruction still works.
When going from K=0 to K=1 all registers are switch to the normal register set: register R14 (flags) is modified with K=1.
When a switch occurs, this will cause a jump (from one R15 register to another)
At reset time:
    all registers of user and supervisor context are set to 0.
    CPU is in Supevisor context
    You may prepare a user context by modifying user context registers : "mov Rx, Ry" with instruction "dstuser" to store values from supervisor register to user register.
Both context start execution at address 0 by default.
Testing K flag allows to determine the context, allowing to share procedure/routine between both context with dedicated behaviour for each.
In interrupt context handling (K=0: supervisor) if I==1 that means the context switch due to a external interrupt signal, otherwise due to program. I==0 (program) at reset time.
When context is switched, the program continue where the last context switch occured.

Program counter R15:PC
   represent the address of the next natural instuction, not the address of current instruction in execution
   branching is typically done by a "mov R15, ..." , "add R15, ..." "sub R15, ..." "jmp"  instructions
   At processor reset time PC is set to 0 ( same for all other registers, in all contexts)
   
   In user context( flag K=1), it is possible to block (get stuck) the processor by the following instruction
    al nf sub R15, 2   ; the instruction is repeated endlessly
   Interrupt signal still handled if flag I=1.
   Same instruction in supervisor context (flag K=0) get stuck forever the cpu by repeating endlessly the instruction.

  If instruction flag is fl then flags are modified.
  example: no fl sub R2, R3  ; z,c,s,v flags modified but R2 is not modified
  A no operation (nop) is doable by the combination of 'no' with 'nf'
  example: no nf sub R2, R3  ; operation executed but nothing is modified.

The assembler have to know other conditions that generate an additional move bit instruction before, 
and change the condition to xs or xc (depending the case)
for instance:
    pl nf sub R1, R2 ;( if S==0 then R1=R1-R2, and do not modify the flags) : can't be assembled in one word
is assembled as
    al nf mov X, R14:4  ;(X flag = S flag)
    xc nf sub R1, R2 ;(if X==0 then R1=R1-R2, and do not modify the flags) : assembled in two words
another example:
    mi nf add R1, R2
is assembled as    
    al nf mov X, R14:4
    xs nf add R1, R2
